# Callang
Callang calls other languages to run scripts while in python

## Currently implemented languages
- Octave
  * MatLab clone with some reverse compatability
  * Used for matric processing and general analytics
- R
  * General statistical analysis language

## Issues noticed

- Octave (.m) files will only run on relative paths if they are scripts, not functions
